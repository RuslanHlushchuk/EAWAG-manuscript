## Abstract {.page_break_before}

A large corpus of Cichlids from Lake Victoria in Africa spanning a size range of 6 to 20 cm was nondestructively using micro-computed tomography.
The presented manuscript describes a method to efficiently obtain three-dimentional tomographic datasets of the oral and pharyngeal jaws and the whole skull of these fishes.
We describe in detail how the data has been acquired to aid in reproducible research.
The tomographic data we acquired (XXX GB raw data and XXX GB projection) images is used for further projects, an outlook on two of them; a morphological description of the oral and pharyngeal jaws of the fishes as well as a principal component analysis of landmark features on the fish skulls.
