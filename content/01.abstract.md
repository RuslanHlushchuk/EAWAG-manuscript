## Abstract {.page_break_before}

A large corpus of Cichlids from Lake Victoria in Africa spanning a size range of 6 to 20 cm was nondestructively imaged using micro-computed tomography.
The presented manuscript describes a method to efficiently obtain three-dimensional tomographic data sets of the oral and pharyngeal jaws and the whole skull of these fishes.
We describe in detail how the data has been acquired to aid in reproducible research.
The tomographic data we acquired (8.8 TB projection images) was reconstructed into 1.4 TB of three-dimensional images which are used for further projects.
Herein we present our method and an outlook on two projects analyzing the acquired data; a morphological description of the oral and pharyngeal jaws of the fishes as well as a principal component analysis of landmark features on the fish skulls.
