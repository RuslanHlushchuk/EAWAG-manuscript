## Introduction {.page_break_before}

### History

- Cichlids from Lake Victoria
- Sample 'library' of EAWAG
- Valuable, hence non-destructive imaging is *paramount*

[TODO]: # (Add some information on the backstory of those fishes, and maybe publications relating to the corpus of fishes)

### micro-CT

Microcomputed tomography is a valuable tool to gain insights into the inner structure of very diverse samples, namely for specimens related to research done in the biomedical sciences.
Namely in the 'fish sciences', microcomputed tomography has been employed as a method of choice to non-destructively assess the morphology of various samples [@https://osf.io/ecmz4] ^[For which David made a tomographic scan of an adult zebrafish ages ago.]

Depending on the structures of interest biomedical samples are often tomographically scanned after the tissue/sample has been stained with a contrast agent, most often employing contrast agents containing heavy metals.
Since the structures of interest for the two studies we touch upon in this manuscript (cichlid teeth and skull bones) display large enough contrast to the surrounding tissue we did not stain our samples prior to the tomographic imaging presented here.

[TODO]: # (Mention the `fishguy` some more? [@https://www.washington.edu/storycentral/story/uw-professor-is-digitizing-every-fish-species-in-the-world].)
