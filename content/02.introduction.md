### micro-CT

- Nondestructive imaging of a diverse kind of samples
- Ideal method to provide insight into *these* samples
- Has been used to investigate fishes before, e.g. 'fishguy'^[For which David made a tomographic scan of an adult zebrafish ages ago.] [@https://www.washington.edu/storycentral/story/uw-professor-is-digitizing-every-fish-species-in-the-world].
