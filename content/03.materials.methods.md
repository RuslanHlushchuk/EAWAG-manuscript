## Materials and Methods {.page_break_before}

### Preparation of fishes

- Collection
- Storage in 75% Ethanol.

### micro-CT imaging

- Scanned on the 1272 (some fishes) and the 2214 (most of the fishes)

[TODO]: # (Pull the data from *all* log files with a notebook)

### Data analysis
#### Preparation for analysis

### Image processing

We wrote a set of *Jupyter* [@https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/403913] notebooks with *Python* code to work with the images and wrangle the acquired data.
The notebooks were written at the start of the project, to be able to process new scans as soon as they were reconstructed.
Re-runs of the notebook added newly scanned and reconstructed fishes to the analysis, facilitating a nearly constant quality check of the scans and batched processing of the data.

All Jupyter notebooks for this work are available online [@doi:10.5281/zenodo.6798632].

#### Extraction of OJ and PJ

- Details needed from Mikki on how she did it exactly

#### PCA of skull landmarks

- Very superficial description of work from Kassandra.
  We do *not* want to cannibalize her upcoming manuscript, but only hint at what will be done.
