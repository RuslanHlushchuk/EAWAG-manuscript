### Sample procurement and preparation

The fishes were kept in 75% Ethanol for long-term storage in the EAWAG fish library.
They were delivered to the Institute of Anatomy for microtomographic investigation sorted into several batches by approximately equal length.

[TODO]: # (Were they transported to Bern as 'Gefahrengut'-Transport? This would be a remarkable little tidbit to add to the manuscript)

### micro-CT imaging

All samples were scanned on two of the three available high-resolution 3D X-ray microtomography scanners of the Institute of Anatomy of the University of Bern in Switzerland, a SkyScan 1272 and a SkyScan 2214 (both Bruker microCT, Kontich, Belgium).

The fishes were sorted into 'bins' based on their physical size.
We used a custom-made sample-holder to scan each of the fish in our machines.
A sample holder was 3D-printed on a Form 2 desktop stereolithography printer (Formlabs, Somerville, Massachusetts, USA) and is freely available online [@https://github.com/TomoGraphics/Hol3Drs/blob/master/STL/EAWAG.Fish.stl] as part of a library of sample holders for tomographic scanning of biomedical samples [@doi:10.5281/zenodo.2587555].
The sample holder was custom-made for this project and is easily parametrized to the different width, height and length classes of the fishes.

In total, we acquired 340 tomographic scans of 127 different fishes.
All the scanning parameters are collected in a table in the [Supplementary Materials], a generalized rundown is given below.

Since the fishes greatly varied in their length, the voxel sizes of each of the acquired datasets also varies greatly.
We acquired datasets with (isometric) voxel sizes ranging from 3--50 μm.

Depending on the size of the specimen we set the x-ray source voltage to 50--80 kV and---depending on the voltage---to a current between 107 and 200 μA.
Also depending on the size of the fishes, the x-ray spectrum was filtered either by an Aluminum filter of varying thickness (either 0.25, 0.5 or 1 mm) before digitization to projection images or recorded in an unfiltered way.
I total we recorded 8.8 TB of projections images (`*.?if` files) for this project.

All the recorded projection images were subsequently reconstructed into a 3D stack of axial PNG images spanning the regions of interest of each fish.
We reconstructed the projection images with NRecon (Version 1.7.4.6, Bruker microCT, Kontich Belgium) with varying ring artifact and beam hardening correction values, depending on each fish (again, all relevant values are listed in the [Supplementary Materials]).
In total, this resulted in 1.4 TB of reconstruction images (`*rec*.png` files).

A small bash script [@https://github.com/habi/EAWAG/blob/master/rsync-fishes.sh] was used to generate redundant (archival) copies of the raw projection images and copy all the files to a shared network drive on the `research_storage` infrastructure of the University of Bern.

[TODO]: # (I *still* would like to be able to make as much data as possible accessible to other researchers. Can we don this as part of this manuscript?)

### Data analysis
#### Preparation for analysis

### Image processing

We wrote a set of *Jupyter* [@https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/403913] notebooks with *Python* code to work with the images and wrangle the acquired data.
The notebooks were written at the start of the project, to be able to process new scans as soon as they were reconstructed.
Re-runs of the notebook added newly scanned and reconstructed fishes to the analysis, facilitating a nearly instant quality check of the scans and batched processing of the data.

All Jupyter notebooks for this work are available online [@doi:10.5281/zenodo.6798632].

#### Extraction of OJ and PJ

To extract the oral jaw (OJ) and pharyngeal jaw (PJ) of the fishes, we used [3DSlicer](https://www.slicer.org) (Version 4.11.20210226) [@doi:10.1016/j.mri.2012.05.001] extended with the SlicerMorph tools [@doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13669] which help biologists to work with 3D specimen data.
The reconstructed `.png` stacks were loaded into ImageStacks, depending on their size we reduced the image resolution (e.g. downscaled the images) for this first step.
The three-dimensional volume was rendered via [VTK GPU Ray Casting](https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/modules/volumerendering.html).
A custom-made volume property (created by Kassandra Ford) was used as an input to view the scans.
Using toggles in the volume rendering, we defined regions of interest (ROIs) for both the OJs and PJs in each specimen..
These ROIs were then extracted in their native resolution from the original dataset for further processing.
Using the grayvalue thresholding function in Slicers Segment Editor the teeh in both the oral and pharyngeal jaws were extracted.
We used the 'Scissor' and 'Island' tools of the Segment Editor to isolate single regions.

Processed regions of interest were exported as NRRD [@https://w.wiki/5mBK] files.
The three-dimensional visualizations of all regions of interest for each speciment were compiled into overview images (see Figure @fig:kat13pptx for an example from the compilation document).
In total we compiled overview of XXX specimens with full head morphology, oral jaw and lower pharnygeal jaw profiles.

[TODO]: # (Do we really need to specify 'created by Kassandra Ford' for the custom-made property?)
[TODO]: # (Accurate specimen number in .pptx file from Mikki. The PPTX file `CT scan slides_ML_March26_2022.pptx` contains 112 slides...)

#### PCA of skull landmarks

- Very superficial description of work from Kassandra.
  We do *not* want to cannibalize her upcoming manuscript, but only hint at what will be done.

#### Automatic extraction of otoliths

- MIPs are oriented *anteroposterior*, *lateral* and *dorsoventral*
- Simple grayvalue plot along the longest axis
- Find peak of this grayvalue 
- Otolith is around maximum gray value along fish, (see Figure @fig:otolither)
